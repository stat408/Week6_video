# Types of Graphs



## Why use Graphics

- Why do you, or have you, in the past used data graphics?
    - Exploratory Graphics
    - Publication Graphics
    - Presentation Graphics

# Graphics in R

## Exercise: Visualizing Patterns Over Time

- What are we looking for with data over time?

## Solution: Visualizing Patterns Over Time

- What are we looking for with data over time?
    - Trends (increasing/decreasing)
    - Are season cycles present?
- Identifying these patterns requires looking beyond single points
- We are also interested in looking at more the data in more detail
    - Are there outliers?
    - Do any time periods look out of place?
    - Are there spikes or dips?
    - What causes any of these irregularities?

## Capital Bikeshare Data

```{r , mysize=TRUE, size='\\tiny'}
library(readr)
bike.data <- read_csv('http://www.math.montana.edu/ahoegh/teaching/stat408/datasets/Bike.csv')
```

## Capital Bikeshare Data

```{r}
library(lubridate)
library(dplyr)
bike.data <- bike.data %>% mutate(year = as.factor(year(datetime)), month = as.factor(month(datetime)))
monthly.counts <- bike.data %>% group_by(month) %>% summarize(num_bikes = sum(count)) %>% arrange(month)
monthly.counts
```

## Discrete Points: Bar Charts

```{r, echo = F}
library(ggplot2)
monthly.counts %>% ggplot(aes(y = num_bikes, x = month)) + geom_bar(stat = 'identity') + xlab('Month') + ylab('Bike Rentals') + labs(title = 'Bike Rentals per Month in 2011-2012 \n Capital Bikeshare in Washington, DC', caption = 'Source: www.capitalbikeshare.com')

## Exercise: Visualizing Proportions

- What to look for in proportions?

## Visualizing Proportions

- What to look for in proportions?
    - Generally looking for maximum, minimum, and overall distribution.
- Many of the figures we have discussed are useful here as well: for example, stacked bar charts or points to look at changes in proportions over time.
- Another possibility is the waffle plot we've previously seen.

## Exercise: Visualizing Relationships

- When considering relationships between variables, what are we looking for?

## Visualizing Relationships

- When considering relationships between variables, what are we looking for?
    - If something goes up, do other variables have a positive relationship, negative relationship, or no relationship.
    - What is the distribution of your data? (both univariate and multivariate)
